# Movie Recommendation System with Python

https://github.com/Digital-Ibraheem/Movie-Recommendation-System

## Overview
This project builds a movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques, leveraging user ratings and metadata to suggest movies that a user may like. The goal is to provide personalized movie suggestions based on historical preferences, improving user experience and increasing engagement with the platform.

## Features
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies based on user similarities and rating patterns.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests movies with similar attributes (genres, actors, directors).
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering to improve recommendation accuracy.
- **Interactive Interface**: Allows users to input their preferences and get movie suggestions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis and building machine learning models.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and handling movie datasets.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computations, enabling efficient operations on movie data.
- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for building recommendation models using collaborative filtering and clustering algorithms.
- **Surprise**: A library specifically designed for building and analyzing recommender systems.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Used for visualizing the movie recommendation results and data insights.

## Algorithms Used
- **Collaborative Filtering**: This algorithm recommends movies based on user-user or item-item similarities. It uses user ratings to find similar users or movies and recommends movies based on that.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: The content-based algorithm suggests movies that are similar to ones the user has liked, based on features like genre, director, and cast.
- **Hybrid Filtering**: A combination of collaborative and content-based filtering is used to enhance the recommendation accuracy by considering both user preferences and movie features.

## Installation
To set up this project, ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn surprise matplotlib seaborn
